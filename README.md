# OBJECT Detection Using YOLO
The main contribution in this project is to use the state of the art YOLO Neural network architecture to train the model on custom datasets collected for persons and objects in undreground mines.

The products of such a initiative are,
1. Leg Detection for smart cane project : Applying Computer vision to detect objects in the environment and assist blind people to navigate through busy environments. The dataset developed essentially consists of a single class, which are hand annoted images of legs of persons.
# Results:

2. Real time object detection of personal and equipment in under ground mines: 

Two custom datasets are created for training YOLO and achieve the project goals
